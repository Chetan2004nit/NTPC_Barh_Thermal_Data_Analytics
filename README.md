# NTPC Barh Boiler Emission Analysis Project

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of a thermal power plant boiler system, based on NTPC Barh (Stage-2), with a focus on **operational efficiency**, **emission control**, and **performance monitoring**.


##  Objective

To analyze synthetic yet realistic data from a supercritical thermal power plant boiler to:
- Evaluate boiler efficiency trends
- Monitor SO‚ÇÇ emissions and fly ash levels
- Detect trip patterns and correlate them with operational variables
- Derive actionable business insights using Python data tools




## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
